        <h3>Research</h3>

<p>I have segregated my research work into appropriate categories below. Each section contains a brief description of my work/interest in that area as well as any publications I have co-authored on that topic of interest.</p>

<h4>Synthetic Inorganic Materials Chemistry</h4>
<p>The majority of my research work was performed in synthetic inorganic materials chemistry. I spent time in the Stein lab at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities working on metal oxides, metal chalcogenides, and metal-organic frameworks, examining the interplay between synthesis and structure in these various materials. I carried this interest with me to the Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy at the University of Cambridge, where I worked in the Functional and Hybrid Inorganic Materials group on metal-organic frameworks and hybrid perovskites.</p>

<h4>Error-Correcting Code Theory</h4>
<p>Through the University of Minnesota Talented Youth Mathematics Program (UMTYMP), I was put into contact with Dr. David Clark (now Prof. at Grand Valley State University), who introduced me to error-correcting code theory. The work I did with him was an exploration of 2-error-correcting codes in order to determine the 'best' 2-error-correcting code; while I didn't get that far I very much enjoyed the exploration of these interesting mathematical objects.</p>

<h4>Mathematical Neuroscience</h4>
<p>I worked with Prof. Duane Nykamp at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities on mathematical models of firing neurons. Along with a group of undergraduate summer researchers, we explored the dynamics of these firing networks with many of the methods of nonlinear dynamics.</p>
